# Prisma CLI (migrations) and runtime use this.
# By default we connect to a PostgreSQL database (e.g. Neon DB) using the
# DATABASE_URL below. During development you can override this locally by
# creating a `.env.local` file or when deploying to Vercel by adding the same
# variable in the project settings / .env.vercel file.
#
# To switch to a SQLite database instead simply uncomment the following line
# and comment out the PostgreSQL URL. This makes it easy to toggle between
# providers without editing code.

# Example PostgreSQL URL (Neon):
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DB?sslmode=require"

# Alternative SQLite (development fallback):
# DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
